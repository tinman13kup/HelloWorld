insanity on a Friday night
I'm just a middle aged old guy looking to jump into some coding AND electronics at the same time, hense the insanity
I'm not quite happy just buying "modules" or assemblies and plugging them in, copy some code and make it blink. I want 
to design and build that module, then create the code for it as well. I had component level electronics schooling in the Navy 20-some odd years ago and most is a bit fuzzy.
